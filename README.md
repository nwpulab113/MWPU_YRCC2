# NWPU_YRCC2
A dataset for ice segmentation
## Overview
We built a UAV image dataset named NWPU_YRCC2 for fine-grained river ice semantic segmentation. All UAV images were collected in the Ningxiaâ€“Inner Mongolia reach of the Yellow River, since the ice phenomenon in this reach is very typical and diverse. The dataset consists of 1525 precisely labeled images covering typical river ice images with different characteristics.
