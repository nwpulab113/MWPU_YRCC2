# NWPU_YRCC2
A dataset for ice segmentation
## Overview
Ice caps, ice plugs, or ice dams are often formed in high latitude rivers in winter, which could change the hydraulic, thermal, and geometric boundary conditions of water flow and form a unique ice phenomenon in winter. Ice plugs or ice dams, i.e., drift ice in the river channel blocking the cross section of water flow, may cause water level rise, inundate farmland houses, damage the coastal hydraulic structures, cause shipping interruption, or cause hydraulic power loss. Therefore, river ice monitoring is necessary in preparing for potential hazards. Accurate fine-grained ice semantic segmentation is a key technology in the study of river ice monitoring, which can provide more information for ice situation analysis, change trend prediction, and so on.

We built a UAV image dataset named NWPU_YRCC2 for fine-grained river ice semantic segmentation. All UAV images were collected in the Ningxiaâ€“Inner Mongolia reach of the Yellow River, since the ice phenomenon in this reach is very typical and diverse. The dataset consists of 1525 precisely labeled images covering typical river ice images with different characteristics.
